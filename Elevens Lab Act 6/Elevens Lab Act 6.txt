1. You can only replace 5? and 6? or 5? and 6?.
2. As stated in the lab, you can only remove cards in pairs that add up to eleven or pairs of 3 of J Q and K. If there are only 3 cards left, that must mean that all the pairs of number cards have been removed and that only J Q and K remain. Therefore, the amount of cards remaining on the board without there being a full  must be able have a pair with another card no matter where it is. Thus, only a single J Q and K remain.
3. This game does not involve any strategy. This game is solely based on luck and the order that the computer generates the cards. This is because with each given number card, there is only a single other number that allows it to add up to eleven. If the card is not present, you must look for other pairs. Same thing goes with the J Q and K. You can only have one of each before you can remove it from play. This selectiveness of this game and stringent rules require you to just cycle through with the moves that you are able to do. Otherwise, you would not be able to "win" this game.
